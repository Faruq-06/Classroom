### Course Description

This course introduces the design, analysis, and implementation of algorithms. Students will learn fundamental algorithmic techniques such as divide-and-conquer, greedy strategies, dynamic programming, and graph algorithms. The course emphasizes efficiency analysis using Big-O notation and explores NP-completeness, approximation, and randomized algorithms.
