## **Lab Objectives**

Upon completion of this lab, students will be able to:

- Implement fundamental data structures (arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs)
- Develop and analyze sorting/searching algorithms (selection, insertion, merge, quick, radix)
- Implement recursion-based solutions (Fibonacci, factorial, series summations)
- Apply divide-and-conquer, greedy, and dynamic programming techniques (Knapsack, matrix chain multiplication)
- Explore backtracking (N‑Queens, subset sum) and graph algorithms (DFS, BFS, Dijkstra)
